## Cloudflare Worker Proxy
This is a simple Cloudflare Worker that acts as a proxy. When a request is sent to the worker, it forwards the request to the specified URL using the same HTTP method as the original request (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and then returns the response.

How It Works
Request Handling: The worker listens for incoming HTTP requests.
Forwarding Request: Based on the request method (e.g., GET, POST), the worker forwards the request to the URL provided in the request.
Returning Response: The worker returns the response received from the requested URL back to the client.
Usage
Deploy the Worker: Deploy this Cloudflare Worker using the Cloudflare dashboard or with Wrangler.
Send a Request: Send a request to the deployed worker with the URL you want to fetch.
Receive the Response: The worker will fetch the response from the provided URL and return it.
Example
To send a GET request through the worker:

bash
**curl -X GET "https://<your-worker-url>/?url=https://example.com"**
To send a POST request through the worker:

bash
``curl -X POST "https://<your-worker-url>/?url=https://example.com" -d '{"key":"value"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"``

Notes
The URL to be requested must be passed as a query parameter named url.
The worker will forward all headers and body data as is to the specified URL.
